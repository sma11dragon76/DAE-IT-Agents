        <h1>DAE Modular AI Agent Platform – Business & Technical Plan</h1>

        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>DAE is a leading provider of integrated hardware and software solutions for energy retail stations across APAC and China. Our Forecourt Controller (FCC), Central Management System (CMS), and POS solutions are deployed at over 20 customer sites, enabling seamless management of dispensers, EV chargers, hydrogen pumps, ATG, CCTV, and more. With access to comprehensive station-level data through our CMS, DAE aims to launch a suite of modular AI Agents tailored to replicate or enhance key operational roles within energy retail businesses. These AI Agents will be modular, integrable with third-party CMS platforms, and commercially available to energy providers in APAC and the Middle East.</p>

        <h2>Business Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Enhance or replace existing roles in energy retail businesses using AI Agents.</li>
            <li>Offer modular AI functionality tailored to specific roles like Finance, Operations, HSSE, Wetstock, Logistics, Marketing, Pricing, and IT.</li>
            <li>Ensure interoperability with third-party CMS platforms via robust API ingestion and transformation layers.</li>
            <li>Commercialize AI Agents through our existing CMS platform or as add-ons to competitors' platforms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Market Opportunity</h2>
        <p>The energy retail sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation. With increasing complexity in managing fuel, EV, hydrogen, and other energy types, AI can drive major improvements in efficiency, compliance, and profitability. Modular AI Agents offer a scalable, non-disruptive path to automation, meeting immediate and evolving needs of operators across APAC and the Middle East.</p>
